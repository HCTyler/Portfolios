    <p>
      Hello, my name is Edgar Fernandez and I am a front-end developer. 
      I am seeking out opportunities to collaborate with you and bring my 5 years experience working in a customer service to help build your application.
      After completing my coding bootcamp program through the University of California- San Diego, I have found that my passion lies in creativity that comes with web development. I am here to create an application that not only looks good but is also interactive and responsive.
